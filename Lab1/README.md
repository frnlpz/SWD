# Lab work #1

Write a program that will prompt the user for a temperature in degrees Celsius, and then an F for Fahrenheit or K for Kelvin. The script will print the corresponding temperature in the scale specified by the user. For example, the output might look like this:

_Enter the temp in degrees C: 29.3_

_Do you want F or K? F_

_The temp in degrees F is 84.7_

The format of the output should be exactly as specified here. The conversions are:

#### F = 9/5 Â· C+32,
#### K = C+273.15.
